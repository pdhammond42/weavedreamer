WIF VERSION 1.1 DEVELOPERS

In response to interest in the continued development of the 
WIF specification, an email list was created in February 1997.
The Version 1.1 specification is a result of discussions 
conducted through the WIF list. While agreement may not have
been unanimous on all changes in the 1.1 specification, no list
participants expressed serious objection to any of the accepted
changes.

III.  WIF PHILOSOPHY

RATIONALE

Prior to WIF each weaving program used its own format for storing 
weave information.  Each format is especially suited to the 
individual program, but does not lend itself to translation 
across programs.  In addition files are machine readable only. 
WIF is designed to bridge the gap between programs. 

CRITERIA

The Weaving Information File (WIF) specification is designed to 
meet the following criteria: 

1.  It can evolve and change as the need arises, without 
rendering earlier versions unreadable by new programs nor later 
versions unreadable by older programs. 

2.  It can be understood by a human reader. 

3.  It can be read by any computer capable of reading an ASCII 
text file. 

To meet the above criteria, the WIF takes the form of a Microsoft 
Windows ".INI" file.  But it departs from this standard in at 
least one important way.  WIF files are not limited to 64K, as 
are Windows 3.1 ini files.  This means that standard Windows 3.1 
functions can NOT be used to process WIF files.  Programmers must 
write their own utilities to read and write WIF files. 
_______________________________________________________ 


IV.  WIF SPECIFICATION NARRATIVE

The WIF specification consists of a set of English language 
Section and Key names and agreements on how the data will be 
presented.  Where several possible data formats exist, preference 
will be given to the format that meets all three criteria. 
Efficiency is sacrificed in favor of readability by humans. 
Specifically, efficient bit sensitive numbers are abandoned in 
favor of comma separated arrays understandable by a weaver. 

SECTION AND KEY NAMES

The INI file specification dictates that section names are in 
brackets [section name] and key names are followed by an equals 
sign and the data:  Keyname=data. 

Data key names should not be duplicated in a single WIF file.  
WIF reader implementations might favor either the first or last 
of duplicates, leading to ambiguity.  Even though duplicate key 
names are an error in the file, programs should be able to deal 
with the error without crashing. 

COMMENTS

Comments may be freely included if prefaced by a semicolon at the 
beginning of the line.  Comments may also be included following a 
numeric entry or boolean entry.  While not required, these 
comments should be prefixed by a semicolon.  Key lines containing 
a text string may not contain a comment. 


INFORMATIONAL AND DATA SECTIONS

For the purpose of the WIF specification, sections are defined as 
"INFORMATIONAL" and "DATA" Sections.  The [CONTENTS] section is a 
special Informational Section that lists all other included 
Sections with the exception of [TRANSLATIONS] and [WIF], which 
appear separately, preferable at the beginning of the file.  
(Support for the Translations section has been suspended with 
Version 1.1.)  Each section which a program has included in a 
given WIF file must be listed in [CONTENTS] as a boolean Keyline 
with a value of true (yes).  This tells the processing program 
that the section exists.  Sections which are not implemented by a 
program or which are not included in the current file are NOT 
required to be listed in the [CONTENTS] section--but may still be 
listed with a value of false. WIF reader programs should set the 
default value for all sections to false prior to reading 
[CONTENTS].  
 

UPPER AND LOWER CASE

By convention, Section names are upper case and Key Names are 
upper/lower case.  But programs must process all section and key 
names in a case insensitive manner.  Specifically, the section 
names which appear as key names under [CONTENTS] may commonly 
appear in upper case, since they are also Section names. 

ORDER INDEPENDENCE

Programs that process WIF files may not depend on a specific 
order of section names, nor of key lines within sections.  Note 
that this precludes the use of the Windows 
ReadPrivateProfileString with a nil Key to put all lines in a 
section into a buffer.  While the order of Key lines in data 
sections like [THREADING] might be expected to be written in 
numeric order, the WIF standard says that each Key must be 
evaluated in case this order is not followed. 

This stated, however, some programs may work most efficiently 
with a preferred Section order.  See "Unofficial Programmer's 
Comments: Ravi Nielsen" following the official specification. 


PRIVATE SECTIONS

Version 1.1 supports the addition of Private sections which 
contain data specific to a particular program--data which may or 
may not be relevant to other programs.  There may be cases where 
a program may wish to support another program's private sections, 
AND include private sections of its own.  For this reason, 
private sections must include a unique "Source ID" in their name, 
so that programs may distinguish between their own and another 
program's private sections.  

The only requirement is that a Source ID must be unique--not 
conflict with other developer's programs.   If you want to, you 
may optionally "register" you Source ID to help avoid inadvertant 
duplications of IDs.  

Here is a listing of current registered Source IDs:  

Maple Hill Software:  MHSPWSW
Swiftweave:           SWve

(Send your request to register your ID to ravi@mhsoft.com.)

Private sections must follow this format:

                [PRIVATE <SourceID> <SectionName>]

SPACING AND THICKNESS VALUES

If a program only supports one out of Thickness and Spacing, the 
correct section to read from a file that has both Spacing and 
Thickness is Spacing, even if the program calls that quantity 
Thickness for its own purposes.  Corollary: a program that 
supports only thickness (in its own internal terminology) should 
write its data to the Spacing section or to be completely 
unambiguous, write both Spacing and Thickness sections with 
identical data. 


DEFAULT VALUES AND SPARSE DATA SECTIONS

Programs must be able to handle missing keylines in the Data 
Sections.  The WARP and WEFT sections provide the default color, 
spacing, and thickness values to use for each warp and weft 
thread.  All shaft and treadle values should be preinitialized to 
zero, indicating that the warp or weft thread or the tieup is 
unused.  Programs should then create the number of threads 
specified in WARP and WEFT and with the default characteristics 
before reading the data sections.  Individual thread data which 
does not deviate from these defaults may have been omitted from 
the respective data section (sparse data).  In other words, a 
thread looks like the characteristics specified in WARP and WEFT 
unless you find a keyline in a data section which says otherwise. 

On writing a WIF file, Programs may omit keylines equal to the 
default values already specified in WARP and WEFT.  
Implementation of sparse data sections is optional; programs may 
continue to write out all data.

V.  THE WIF FORMAT SPECIFICATION

Minimum WIF Requirements

Every WIF file must include two sections, WIF, and Contents.  It 
should also contain those keylines within each section which are 
marked required in the specification below.  

The [CONTENTS] section must list as a keyline with a value "true" 
all other sections which appear in the current WIF file.  

The boolean values of the sections listed as Keylines determine 
whether the Section itself exists.  Only Keylines in the CONTENTS 
section with a value of true are required.  If the Section 
Keyline is omitted, the section does not exist in the current WIF 
file.  Some WIF files list all possible sections with values of 
true or false indicating whether the section exists. 

Throughout the WIF file, optional boolean values are to be 
assumed FALSE by the reader if not present in the section. 

;- Obsolete keylines are marked obsolete with a semicolon and 
minus sign.  They are included in the specification for 
completeness.  Programs should not issue error messages upon 
reading obsolete keylines.  Obviously, obsolete keylines need not 
be generated in new WIF files.  

----------------------------------------

WIF Symbol data type
=1     ; (ASCII numeral)
=X     ; (ASCII character)
='X'   ; '(ASCII character)'
=#219  ; #(integer) (0,255) ;ASCII character 219

The space character must be represented as ' ' or #32.
The "#" character must be represented as '#' or #35.

APPENDIX 

A: UNOFFICIAL PROGRAMMERS' COMMENTS: RAVI NIELSEN

The following notes address issues which fall outside the 
official WIF standard.  They are presented in that light by the 
author, Ravi Nielsen, and represent issues which relate 
specifically to Patternland Weave Simulator and perhaps other 
programs which may in the future use a similar coding strategy. 

1.  PREFERRED SECTION ORDER

Programs which read WIF files must not rely on the order of 
Sections within the file or the order of data lines within 
sections. 

However, some programs (including Patternland) use a multi-
pass sequential read approach, while other programs use 
completely order-independent Windows-style INI file 
functions modified to support files larger than 64K. 

Programs which use the sequential read approach are most 
efficient if the "Information" Sections describing the 
"Data" Sections come first in the file. Patternland uses a 
"smart" 4-pass model. (The first pass for Translations section is 
now obsolete.)  WIF files can be optimized for these programs by 
placing the Information Sections first.  The following list is a 
suggested order for a WIF file optimized for sequential read. 
When files are written in this order, they can be read in one 
pass sequentially without resetting to the beginning.  The order 
of sections within each "pass" is not important. 

;-   1st pass: suspended unless/until Translations supported

;-   suspended  TRANSLATIONS 

2nd pass:

WIF
CONTENTS
COLOR PALETTE
WARP SYMBOL PALETTE
WEFT SYMBOL PALETTE

3rd pass:
  TEXT
  WEAVING
  WARP (this gives me a thread count to show the user)
  WEFT  (likewise)
;-   reserved  BITMAP IMAGE (could present user with size of bitmap)
;-   reserved  BITMAP FILE (could present user with name of bitmap file)

At this point a user selection dialog may be presented 
containing detailed information about the file, allowing the 
user to select what to read. 


4th pass, all the remaining data sections.

Commentary:

By reading Translations first, keynames in the WIF section 
can be translated, however support for translations has been
suspended. 

Because the Color_Palette section contains the RGB 
Range specification, and the Warp and Weft sections 
contain colors, the Color Palette section must be read 
first. 

Once I've read the CONTENTS section I know which of the Pass 
3 major sections to expect.  The group is considered 
complete once I have all the ones listed "yes" in CONTENTS. 

Patternland code assigns a pass group number to each 
section.  As I read the file, if I come upon a section in a 
higher group before I'm done with the current group, the 
program resets to the beginning of the file before reading 
the next group of sections.  If, however, the file was 
written with sections grouped as above, I never have to 
start over and do one continuous sequential read--except for 
pausing after Groups 1-3 to present the user with an 
information and options dialog box.  While this approach may 
seem involved, I believe it to be much faster than 
independently finding each Section/Keyname and reading its 
data. 


2. MULTI-LINE TITLES

Patternland supports multiline Titles; WIF does not.

Patternland replaces CRLF with // on writing a Title to a 
WIF file and replaces // with a CRLF on reading a WIF file.  
If a program supports multiline titles, the programmer may 
wish to adopt this convention. 

New lines are represented by double slashes as per this 
example: 

[TEXT]
Title=A multiline Title//New Line 2//New Line 3


3.  USER OPTIONS

A program that supports WIF files may wish to take advantage 
of the flexibility the specificiation provides for 
extracting specific sections from the file.  A program may 
present the user with a Dialog box on reading a WIF file 
after processing the Informational Sections and learning the 
details of what the file contains; or on writing the file 
before the writing begins.  Following are some of the 
options Patternland provides the user.

Range
  Saving a WIF: Dialog presents the current Warp and Weft limits.
    
    From and To ranges are always written out as Threads 1 
    to Threads [To-From+1]. 

  Reading a WIF:  Dialog presents the ranges contained in 
  the file, i.e., 1 to Threads. 

New/Overwrite/Insert/Add  AT Thread.

  New:  At Thread is forced to 1.  Current weaving is erased 
  and thread ranges are read in starting with 1. 

  Overwrite:  At Thread is enabled.  Thread ranges are read 
  in and replace threads starting with respective warp and 
  weft At Thread values. If range exceeds current weaving, 
  additional threads are added. 

  Insert:  At Thread is enabled.  Thread ranges are read in 
  and inserted starting with respective warp and weft At 
  Thread values. 

  Add: At Thread is disabled.  Reads last thread in current 
  warp and weft. Thread ranges are read in and added to the 
  end of the current weaving. 

Checkboxes are presented for the user to individually select 
  most of the components of the file.

A View option allows the user to view the TEXT information 
  prior to loading the file.
